# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Framework-for-Economic-Time-Series-Prediction

Engineered and preprocessed macroeconomic data from the FRED API, including CPI, unemployment rate, oil price, and interest rate time series.
Built a deep Autoencoder to compress high-dimensional sequences into latent features for pattern discovery.
Applied KMeans clustering on embeddings to segment macroeconomic conditions and enhance feature representation.
Developed a hybrid CNN-LSTM forecasting model, integrating cluster context to improve sequence prediction accuracy.
Achieved 98.34% accuracy in forecasting CPI, with low mean absolute error across test samples.
Technologies used: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, FRED API, Jupyter Notebook; emphasized reproducibility, scalability, and interpretability.
